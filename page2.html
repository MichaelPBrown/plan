<p style="color:white; font-size:20px;text-align:center;">In July we are going to Lake Tahoe to hang out with family friends. We are supposed to be renting a cabin for a while just to have fun and fool around.<br>We
  are going to most likely fish and take boats out on the water a lot and probably some jetskis as well.<br>This is going to be really fun and a great time hopefully, I am very excited to go and see the 
  beautiful Lake Tahoe.
